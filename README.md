MSA 8140 - Data Mangement Class in learning SQL and non-SQL and webscrapping to complete 3 projects in a team we called Crucual Data Team.


## MSA 8040: Database Management for Analytics
The course, Data Management for Analytics, provides an introduction to the database management and data analytics. The course emphasizes the understanding of the fundamentals of database design, ranging from the relational database model to entity relationship modeling, to normalization and to implementation, including both the basic structured query language (SQL) and advanced SQL such as procedure and Trigger. The course also provides an understanding of new developments and trends such as No-SQL (and database on AWS if time allowed). Finally, the course will deliver unstructured data analytics tools, including web scraping using beautifulsoup, selenium and API, textual analysis such as topic modeling and sentim
